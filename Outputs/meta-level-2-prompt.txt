**Instructions:**

1. **Define Scope and Objectives:**
   - Consider what specific educational functionalities are being targeted (e.g., tutoring, quizzes, resource sharing).
   - Identify the goals these enhancements aim to achieve (e.g., improving user engagement, supporting learning outcomes).

2. **Identify Key Stakeholders:**
   - Determine who will be affected by or involved in this enhancement (students, educators, developers).
   - Assess their needs and expectations.

3. **Functional Requirements:**
   - List the essential features required for educational functionality.
   - Consider user interaction aspects such as commands, responses, and feedback mechanisms.

4. **Non-Functional Requirements:**
   - Specify performance criteria like response time, scalability, and reliability.
   - Address security and privacy concerns related to handling educational data.

5. **Integration Aspects:**
   - Examine how new features will integrate with the existing chatbot framework.
   - Identify potential technical challenges or dependencies.

6. **User Experience Considerations:**
   - Highlight user interface and interaction design elements that enhance usability for educational purposes.
   - Propose methods to evaluate user satisfaction and engagement.

7. **Resource Requirements:**
   - Estimate the resources needed, including time, budget, and technology.
   - Identify any additional tools or libraries required for implementation.

8. **Compliance and Standards:**
   - Ensure adherence to relevant educational standards and data protection regulations.

### Secondary Prompt (Generated from Primary):

**Objective:** Conduct a thorough requirement analysis for integrating educational functionalities into the existing Discord-based chatbot.
