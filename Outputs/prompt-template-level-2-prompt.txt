   - Determine specific subject areas or disciplines to focus on (e.g., mathematics, physics, computer science).

2. **Educational Content:**
   - Define the types of advanced concepts that need to be addressed.
   - Specify how toy examples can be used effectively to simplify these complex topics.

3. **Functionality Requirements:**
   - Interactive learning modules or sessions that guide students step-by-step.
   - Features for real-time Q&A and feedback during chat interactions.
   - Mechanisms for tracking progress and suggesting further study materials based on user interaction history.

**Functional Specifications:**

1. **Content Delivery:**
   - How will the bot present educational content? (e.g., text, images, diagrams)
   - What format should toy examples be in? (e.g., simple code snippets, story-based scenarios)

2. **User Interaction:**
   - Define how users will initiate a learning session.
   - Determine interaction patterns for engaging students effectively.

3. **Adaptability and Personalization:**
   - How will the bot assess user understanding and adapt content accordingly?
