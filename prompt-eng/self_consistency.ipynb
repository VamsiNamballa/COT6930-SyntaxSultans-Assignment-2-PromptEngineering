    "# Self Consistency Prompting\n",
    "\n",
    "One of the more advanced techniques in prompt engineering is self-consistency, introduced by `Wang et al. (2022)`. \n",
    "\n",
    "This method seeks to improve upon the traditional greedy decoding typically used in chain-of-thought (CoT) prompting. \n",
    "\n",
    "The core concept involves sampling multiple diverse reasoning paths through few-shot CoT and leveraging these variations to determine the most consistent answer. The technique  enhances the effectiveness of CoT prompting, particularly for tasks requiring arithmetic and commonsense reasoning.\n",

      "To transform the Discord chatbot into an effective educational tool using the Owlmind framework, the focus should be on interactivity and personalization:\n",
      "\n",
      "1. **Interactive Features**: By introducing quizzes, progress tracking, and resource recommendations, students engage with the material actively, enhancing retention.\n",
      "\n",
      "2. **Adaptive Learning Methodologies**: Adopting methods like Socratic questioning or problem-based learning encourages critical thinking and application of knowledge.\n",
      "\n",
      "3. **Personalized Educational Journeys**: Tailoring content delivery based on individual assessments ensures that each student receives appropriate challenges and support.\n",
      "\n",
      "4. **AI Model Enhancements**: Improved NLU, contextual memory, emotion detection, and visual aids will make the chatbot more intuitive, engaging, and effective in delivering complex concepts.\n",
      "\n",
      "5. **Example Interactions**: Through carefully crafted scenarios like those above, students can see how theoretical knowledge is applied practically, making learning both accessible and enjoyable.\n",
      "\n",
      "By implementing these strategies, the enhanced educational bot will be well-equipped to simplify advanced topics for a diverse student audience using interactive and personalized approaches.\n",
